In today's world of smart living, an I-Wallet provides a way for everyone- especially the vidually impaired and the disabled,to keep track of our regular possessions and monitors them in real time. It is a far better solution than our conventional wallets. It is made up of some integrated electronic devices which provides unique features to the wallet such as tracking ability incase of misplacement or theft, minimalist size, RFID blocking feature, durability and more. We can also keep track of our generally used valuable personal items like paper currency, credit/debit cards, and identification documents like identification card, driverâ€™s license, PAN card etc. along with business cards and other useful items. It also spares us from the struggle to remember the amount of cash spent in a day.
